# Rules Extraction

A small utility to extract the rules from the Formula Student Germany rule book
and convert it to a restructured text format for use on the wiki.

The documentation for the `pdftotext` package used is found
[here](https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext)

## Sample Output (`rules.json`)
Extract from JSON file generated by parser:

```json
{ 
"A": {
    "sections": {
        "1": {
            "title": "COMPETITION OVERVIEW",
            "subsections": {
                "1": {
                    "title": "Competition Objective",
                    "rules": {
                        "1": "The competition challenges teams of university students to conceive, design, fabricate,develop and compete with small, formula style, race cars.",
                        "2": "..."
                    },
                    "notes": ""
                },
                "2": {...},
                ...
            }
        },
        "2": {...},
        "3": {...},
        ...
    }
}
}
```
